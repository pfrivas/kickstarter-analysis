### Purpose
* The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louise with a series of trends through visualization and statistics in order to determine which months would be the best to start a kickstarter campaign for a theater and plays and uncover trends in order to help Louise find the most success in her campaign

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* The month of May had the most successful Kickstarter Campaign
* January, June, July, and October all had approximately the same number of failed campaigns launched

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
* The most successful kickstarter campaigns for plays were those with a goal less than $1000
* The least successful kickstarter campaign for plays were those between $45000 to $49999
* No kickstarter campaigns for plays were cancelled

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A challenge encountered was not being able to get a correct line graph for the Outcomes based on goals chart
* This was due to accidentally highlighting the "pledged" column in the COUNTIFS function instead of highighting the "goals" column

Another challenge encountered was not being able to get the subheadings and bullet points to wotk on GitHub
* This was due to not adding a space between the "#" or "*" and the desired text
